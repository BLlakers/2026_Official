# Telemetry Configuration
# This file controls how telemetry data is captured during robot operation.
# Place on USB stick or in deploy directory.

# Telemetry verbosity level (NONE, MATCH, LAB, VERBOSE)
#   NONE    - No telemetry capture (silent mode)
#   MATCH   - Essential data for competition matches (~20 Hz effective)
#   LAB     - Detailed data for practice and tuning (~50 Hz)
#   VERBOSE - Maximum detail for deep debugging (~100+ Hz)
telemetry.level=LAB

# Enable USB stick detection for log storage
# When true, logs are written to USB if detected (/media/sda1/FRC_LOGS)
# When false or USB not found, logs go to /home/lvuser/logs
telemetry.usb.enabled=true

# Enable NetworkTables logging to data log
# When true, all SmartDashboard/NetworkTables values are also logged
# This enables full replay in AdvantageScope including dashboard values
telemetry.networktables.enabled=true

# Custom log path (optional, overrides USB detection)
# Uncomment to force logs to a specific location
# telemetry.path=/home/lvuser/custom_logs
